## SELF INTRO

Hey there,

I'm Chinmay Ajith, a S1 student pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science. I'm really passionate about programming and I'm eager to enhance my skills in this field. I find the world of coding fascinating and love diving into various projects to improve my abilities. 

## INTROSPECTION

### WHY SHOULD YOU CHOOSE ME?

I'm enthusiastic about joining the club and being a part of a community that shares a common interest in programming. I'm hoping to engage in collaborative projects, learn from fellow members, and gain exposure to different programming languages, tools, and techniques. Additionally, I'm excited about the prospect of attending workshops, hackathons, and talks that can help me further develop my programming skills and expand my knowledge in this field. Ultimately, I'm looking forward to both contributing to the club and benefiting from the valuable experiences it has to offer.

### MY 6-MONTH PLAN

In the next six months, my main goal is to enhance my programming skills while effectively managing my college studies and time. I plan to dedicate consistent time to coding practice, working on personal projects, and collaborating with peers to strengthen my programming abilities. By effectively balancing my academic commitments and programming pursuits, I aim to make significant progress in my skill set and contribute positively to the programming club's activities.

### HOW WOULD YOU CONTRIBUTE BACK TO THE CLUB?

I would contribute by sharing my programming experiences, helping fellow members with technical questions, and actively participating in club projects and activities.

Looking forward to building myself at amFOSS!!
